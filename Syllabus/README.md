# Python Boot Camp Syllabus

## Educational Aim
The goal of our Python Boot Camp is to provide you with the skills needed to produce
a portfolio worthy data science/machine learning project.

## Topics to be Covered
In fitting with our educational aim, this course will walk you through the steps
involved in a typical data science/machine learning project. While covering a variety
of important techniques and algorithms we will illuminate themes and motivations
that can be adapted to many data science settings.

Below we outline the specific topics we will be covering in this boot camp.

## Course Structure

The boot camp will meet for twelve one and a half hour long sessions that are led
by an instructor. Most lectures will be accompanied by a homework assignment covering that
lecture's materials. At the end of the twelve lectures students will be given a week to
work on group projects. During that week lectures will be replaced with open office
hours in which lecturers and mentors may provide guidance for the group projects.
The boot camp will end with a presentation day for all group projects.

### Lectures
Each lecture the instructor will progress through a series of jupyter
notebooks as well as prepared python code. These sessions will feature a blend
of lecturing and working in small groups through coding examples. Students are
encouraged to ask questions during lectures in order to ensure they understand the
material.

### Homework
Most sessions will have a corresponding homework set that will highlight the material
covered in said session. Completion of homework sets is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. Working through problems and examples on your own will enrich your experience in the boot camp.

### Group Projects
Each participant must complete a group project by the end of the bootcamp. Projects
should feature the data science/machine learning skills taught in the bootcamp, or
even feature more advanced techniques groups teach themselves outside of bootcamp.
