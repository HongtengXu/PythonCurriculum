# Python Boot Camp Syllabus

## Educational Aim
The goal of our Python Boot Camp is to provide you with the skills needed to produce
a portfolio worthy data science/machine learning project.

## Course Trajectory
In fitting with our educational aim, this course will walk you through the steps
involved in a typical data science/machine learning project. While covering a variety
of important techniques and algorithms we will illuminate themes and motivations
that can be adapted to nearly every data science setting.

Below we outline the specific topics we will be covering in this boot camp.

## Course Structure
### Lectures
The boot camp will meet for ten to twelve one-hour long sessions that feature an
instructor. Each session the instructor will progress through a series of jupyter
notebooks as well as prepared python code. These sessions will feature a blend
of lecturing and working in small groups through coding examples.

### Homework
Most sessions will have a corresponding homework set. Homework sets are not mandatory,
but highly encouraged. Working through problems and examples on your own will enrich
your experience in the boot camp.
