# Prerequisite Material

This folder contains a number of jupyter notebooks that review the minimum knowledge
we are asking participants to have. Each notebook will provide a quick review.
Students can also test their skills in each topic with the corresponding skill
check notebook. 

Note that Probability and Statistics will not have a jupyter notebook,
but rather a 7 page "cheat sheet" with core concepts from Probability Theory and 
Statistics. You by no means need to be an expert in probability theory or statistics, 
but you should have a passing familiarity with the topics presented in the cheat sheet.
In lieu of a Skill Check notebook you can practice the problems provided here, <a href="https://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/sf1901/TCOMK/exercises.pdf">https://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/sf1901/TCOMK/exercises.pdf</a>. You 
don't need to be able to solve all of the problems at the link, they're just offered as a way
for you to practice with answers. Also note that the link was not produced by the boot camp, but
was found with a quick Google search.
