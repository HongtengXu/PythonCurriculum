# PythonCurriculum
This repository contains the curriculum and course materials for our python data science/machine learning boot camp.

The purpose of these boot camps is for our participants to complete an end to end
project that utilizes data science and/or machine learning skills. Our goal is
for each participant to walk out with a portfolio worthy project they can discuss
with potential employers.

In this repository can be found all of the materials utilized in the lessons for
our bootcamps.
